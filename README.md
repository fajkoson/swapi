## Note
adjust config/config.json if you need to, keep in mind there is limited 
number of datasets and best is to keep it on default.

## Examples of usage
- eg1.: swpackage
- eg2.: swpackage --interval 3 (default interval is 5 sec)
- eg3.: tests (this will run all the tests prepared in pytest)


## Implemented functionalities (more in .docs/origtask.md)
- must have: done
- optional tasks:
    - done:
        - create package
        - whole app rewritten as async
        - create dockerfile for creating app docker image (guide in .docs/docker.md)
        - write basic tests (app is able to starts) for sw world app and output yaml data has correct format
        - mock calling sw api in tests
        - add mypy check within tests
    - todo:
        - crete tests for all *.py files and run them before call of main function
